status, assigned to, assigned on, completed on, category, status notes. Each time a team member completes a task in the project
they need to create an issue on GitHub and add that link to this document.  Tasks can be the following categories: Feature, Bug, Docs, or Devops Task  

* Note: This log will be used to determine project contributions and evaluate if each member made adequate and equal contributions to the project.
