## Team Productivity Log

Create a table in a markdown file on your repository and share it with your team. Add columns for issue title,story points, issue link,
status, assigned to, assigned on, completed on, category, status notes. Each time a team member completes a task in the project
they need to create an issue on GitHub and add that link to this document.  Tasks can be the following categories: Feature, Bug, Docs, or Devops Task  

* Note: This log will be used to determine project contributions and evaluate if each member made adequate and equal contributions to the project.
