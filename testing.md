To test the Oracle server with Artillery, you can follow these steps:

Install Artillery by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g artillery

Write a test script in YAML or JSON format that specifies the load test scenario you want to run. This could include information such as the number of virtual users to simulate, the URL of the Oracle server to test, and the types of requests to send.
Run the test using the following command:
arduino

artillery run <path/to/test/script.yaml or .json>

Analyze the results of the test to determine if the Oracle server is able to handle the specified load.

To test Next.js and CSS frameworks with Playwright, you can follow these steps:

Install Playwright by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g playwright

Write a test script in JavaScript that uses Playwright to interact with the Next.js and CSS frameworks you want to test. This could include actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying that certain elements are present on the page.

Run the test using the following command:
bash

playwright test <path/to/test/script.js>

Analyze the results of the test to determine if the Next.js and CSS frameworks are functioning as expected.

Create a test project that includes a package.json file with a list of dependencies.

mkdir test-project

cd test-project

npm init

{
  "name": "test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}


write a code to test and evaluate different node package managers to determine which one is the fastest. (NPM, Yarn, and others)

#!/bin/bash

# Define the list of package managers to test
package_managers=("npm" "yarn" "pnpm")

# Define the list of dependencies to install
dependencies=("express" "lodash" "nodemon" "mongoose" "joi")

# Loop through each package manager and time how long it takes to install the dependencies
for manager in "${package_managers[@]}"
do
  echo "Testing $manager..."

  # Install the dependencies using the package manager and time how long it takes
  time $manager install ${dependencies[@]}

  echo "=============================================="
done


Test and evaluate build tools like Webpack, Veet, and EsBuild to determine their efficiency.

webpack --config webpack.config.js

vite build

esbuild --config=esbuild.config.js


To include checks for coding standards relevant to the project, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, you can add the following tasks to your DevOps pipeline using GitHub Actions:
